    <h2 class = "hlSpan">Why Motivation Sucks</h2>
    <p class="project-card">
        Picture this - You’re laying in your bed, ready to sleep.You’re thinking about how learning this new skill is going to take you places. You think about how you’re gonna learn it. “From tomorrow, I’m going to spend one hour every morning working on this.” You have a plan. Tomorrow marks the start of a new beginning. You’re pumped. You’re motivated. You go to sleep.
<br><br>
I think almost everyone of us has had one of those nights. For most of us, the next morning is usually almost identical to the morning you had the day before. It isn’t the new beginning that you hoped for. 
<br><br>
What went wrong? You had the motivation of an ultimate warrior just the night before. Where did it go? Well, that’s the thing about motivation. It goes as quickly as it comes. Motivation is almost always temporary.
<br><br>
Clarification - I’m not calling motivation a bad thing, motivation does lead you to your best work. This is just a rant on how people fall in this trap of motivation.
<br><br>
Simply put: If you want to do something, just do it. If possible, do it then and there. Don’t keep waiting for that motivation to come back because that’s just not feasible. Motivation doesn’t take you places. Actions do.
<br><br>
“Showing up is half the battle.” It won’t be motivation that will make you show up, it will be discipline.
