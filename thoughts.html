    <p class="project-card">
        These four simple words have become one of the most important anchors for me as Iâ€™ve made mental health a priority this year. <br> 
<br>
To expand on this - You own your thoughts, your thoughts donâ€™t own you. <br><br>

Sounds simple, right? But a good chunk of people (even I was in this category not too long ago) are prisoners of their own thoughts.
<br><br>
Reflecting on how I was early this year, I was someone who was craving for something more. Always had some desires that I had to fulfill. Always part of a race that I was trying to win. I know a lot of people around me who live their life this way. (Maybe this is something you also relate to?)
<br><br>
This lifestyle led me to a place where no matter what I did, I always had a sense of unfulfillment. Discontentment surrounded me and all my problems felt enormous.
<br><br>
I did some of my best work during this time but my mental health deteriorated rapidly. I just couldnâ€™t get a hold of myself. Couldnâ€™t control how I felt. I was a prisoner of my own thoughts.
<br><br>
Once things got too bad, I had to call it quits. I took some time off and spent a few days doing absolutely nothing (something I hadnâ€™t done in years). I only kept asking one question to myself - Why do I feel this way?
<br><br>
I took all my thoughts and feelings, reflected on them, one at a time. During these days, all I did was unbundle the mess my mind had become. What I realized doing this is that all of these thoughts stemmed from something deeper and only if I address the roots of these thoughts will I ever be free from them. And thatâ€™s what I did.
<br><br>
Only then did I realize that the problems that had me surrounded from all sides werenâ€™t really that big, the desires I was chasing werenâ€™t the keys to happiness I was looking for and I am not my thoughts. I own my thoughts and I own how I perceive them. 
<br><br>
Before - I felt how my thoughts made me feel. 
<br>
After - Whenever a thought is taking up a good chunk of my headspace, I reflect on it and address it. Only then can my mind be at peace. Call it â€˜Inbox zero for your headâ€™.
<br>
If I can recommend one practice for anyone whoâ€™s looking to work on their mental health, it would be mindful self reflection.
